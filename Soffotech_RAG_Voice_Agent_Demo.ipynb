    "ai_content = \"\"\"COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO AI\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Modern AI has evolved from early symbolic systems to today's sophisticated neural networks and large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 2: MACHINE LEARNING FUNDAMENTALS\n",
    "Machine learning is a subset of AI focused on algorithms that improve through experience. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for classification and regression. Unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabeled data through clustering and dimensionality reduction. Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 3: DEEP LEARNING\n",
    "Deep neural networks contain multiple hidden layers, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image processing by detecting patterns like edges, shapes, and objects. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs process sequential data for tasks like language translation. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms and have revolutionized NLP with models like GPT and BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 4: NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING\n",
    "NLP enables computers to understand and generate human language. Key techniques include tokenization, word embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT), and language models. Applications range from chatbots and sentiment analysis to machine translation and text summarization. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 demonstrate emergent abilities in reasoning and code generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 5: COMPUTER VISION\n",
    "Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information. Object detection identifies and localizes objects in images. Image segmentation classifies each pixel. Facial recognition systems use deep learning for identity verification. Medical imaging AI assists doctors in diagnosing diseases from X-rays and MRIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 6: AI ETHICS AND CHALLENGES\n",
    "Ethical considerations include bias in training data, privacy concerns, job displacement, and autonomous weapons. Responsible AI development requires transparency, fairness, accountability, and alignment with human values. Challenges include hallucinations in LLMs, adversarial attacks, and ensuring AI safety as systems become more capable.\n",

    "# Document 2: Climate Change\n",
    "climate_content = \"\"\"COMPREHENSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 1: CLIMATE SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS\n",
    "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. The greenhouse effect naturally warms Earth by trapping heat, but human activities have intensified this effect. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases. Global average temperatures have risen approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 2: CAUSES AND ATTRIBUTION\n",
    "Human activities are the dominant cause of observed warming since 1950. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) for energy releases CO2. Deforestation reduces carbon absorption. Industrial processes and agriculture emit methane and nitrous oxide. Scientific consensus attributes over 95% of recent warming to human influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 3: OBSERVED IMPACTS\n",
    "Rising temperatures are causing glaciers and ice sheets to melt, contributing to sea level rise (currently 3.3mm per year). Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, including hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. Ocean acidification threatens marine ecosystems. Changes in precipitation patterns affect agriculture and water resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 4: PROJECTED FUTURE IMPACTS\n",
    "Under current emission trajectories, global temperatures could rise 2.5-4°C by 2100. This would cause catastrophic impacts: widespread coastal flooding, mass extinction of species, food and water scarcity, and increased conflict. Tipping points like Arctic permafrost melt and Amazon rainforest dieback could accelerate warming.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 5: MITIGATION STRATEGIES\n",
    "Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), improving energy efficiency, electrifying transportation, and protecting forests. Carbon capture and storage technologies can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. International cooperation through agreements like the Paris Accord is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 6: ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE\n",
    "Communities must adapt to unavoidable climate impacts through infrastructure upgrades, early warning systems, and sustainable land use. Climate-resilient agriculture includes drought-resistant crops and efficient irrigation. Coastal cities need flood defenses and managed retreat strategies. Public health systems must prepare for heat-related illnesses and disease vector changes.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Document 3: Blockchain Technology\n",
    "blockchain_content = \"\"\"COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 1: BLOCKCHAIN FUNDAMENTALS\n",
    "Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp, and transaction data. This creates an immutable chain where past records cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks. Blockchain operates without a central authority, using consensus mechanisms to validate transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 2: HOW BLOCKCHAIN WORKS\n",
    "Transactions are broadcast to all network nodes. Miners or validators collect transactions into blocks. Consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) determine which node adds the next block. Once added, the block is distributed across the network. Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity, and distributed copies prevent single points of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 3: BITCOIN AND CRYPTOCURRENCIES\n",
    "Bitcoin, created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, was the first cryptocurrency. It uses blockchain to enable peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Bitcoin's PoW consensus requires miners to solve computational puzzles, securing the network but consuming significant energy. The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin creates scarcity. Other cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Litecoin, and stablecoins like USDC.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 4: ETHEREUM AND SMART CONTRACTS\n",
    "Ethereum is a programmable blockchain that executes smart contracts - self-executing code that automatically enforces agreement terms. Developers write contracts in Solidity, deploying them to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts enable decentralized applications (dApps) for finance, gaming, identity, and more. Ethereum 2.0 transitions from PoW to PoS for improved scalability and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 5: DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DeFi)\n",
    "DeFi recreates traditional financial services using blockchain. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap enable token swaps without intermediaries. Lending protocols allow users to earn interest or borrow assets. Yield farming and liquidity mining provide rewards for providing liquidity. DeFi's total value locked (TVL) reached over $100 billion at its peak, though it faces risks like smart contract bugs and regulatory uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER 6: ENTERPRISE BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATIONS\n",
    "Supply chain management uses blockchain for product traceability and authenticity verification. Healthcare systems employ blockchain for secure medical record sharing. Financial institutions explore blockchain for cross-border payments and securities settlement. Governments pilot blockchain-based digital identity systems. Private permissioned blockchains like Hyperledger Fabric offer controlled access for enterprise use cases.\n",
